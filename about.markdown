hello!

i'm lucas and i am a software engineer (previously worked as a devops engineer) and i love building things.
i created this blog so i could have a place to post about my projects / work, share travel stories and also dump
any thoughts i have onto the internet (i don't have / like social media).

i also enjoy rock climbing, snowboarding (any board sport tbh), electronic music, animation and spending time with friends and family.

below you can checkout my github and find me on linkedin!
