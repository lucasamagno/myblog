Hello!

My name is Lucas, I'm a software engineer (previously worked as a devops engineer) and I love building things.
I created this blog so I could have a place to post about my projects / work, share my travels and adventures, and also dump
any thoughts I have onto the internet (I don't have / like social media).

I also enjoy rock climbing, snowboarding (any board sport actually), electronic music, and animation. 

Below you can checkout my Github and find me on LinkedIn!
