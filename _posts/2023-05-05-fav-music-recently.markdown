secret life by fred again.. and brian eno has been my favorite piece of music recently. i spent 8 hours driving on a roadtrip listening to these songs on repeat and i just formed such a deep love for the sound. the songs create such a calming and peaceful atmosphere. its the same style of electronic music that i initially fell in love with 10 years ago. calming, peaceful, atmospheric, and easily attachable to memories in my life. 

my favorite songs off the album are i saw you and trying.
